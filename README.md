# WhatToDoToday
A simple to do list made using Django and JavaScript

To run this you must install:
  - Pthyon 3
  - Django 2.1+
  - Pip
  
Once you navigate to the project's folder in the command line, you run a local server with the command "python manage.py runserver".

Django projects are divided into "apps" which house the logic for your web application. At the moment, this project only has one app which is in the "todo" folder. The HTML rendered by the app is placed in todo/templates/todo/todoCanvas.html.
